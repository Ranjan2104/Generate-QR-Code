# Generate QR Code
 A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode[1]) invented in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company Denso Wave.[2] A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used
